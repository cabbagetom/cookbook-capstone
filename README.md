# Digital Cookbook Capstone

### Created February 2023

This is a digital cookbook project created as a tribute to my grandmother's recipes. The site allows users to:
* browse through recipes
* bookmark recipes they like
* switch between metric and imperial measurements where applicable
* leave feedback in the form of comments (although this is currently dummy functionality)

## Installation

To install the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.
3. To add new recipes, follow the consistent HTML structure used for existing recipes.

## Usage

Once the project is installed, users can browse through the recipes, bookmark their favorite recipes, and leave feedback in the comments section. To switch between metric and imperial measurements, users can simply click the "Metric" or "Imperial" button where available.

## Credits

This project was created as part of the Hyperion Dev course, and I would like to give special thanks to my grandmother for providing the original recipes.
